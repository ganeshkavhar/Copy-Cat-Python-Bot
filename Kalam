Technology should assist the teaching and the students should adopt technology. Teacher should assist students in the learning process and facilitate the students to mine the knowledge on their won in a manner which enriches the knowledge.

Q#I heard 20% of scientists working in NASA are Indians. So they are helping America to become a developed country. But when our own country is struggling to launch a satellite to Mars, why is that scientists are willing to help America?
A#Indian scientists are working in different countries. Science is Borderless. Wherever scientific discovery takes place it transforms into technology and helps many nations. There are about 23 million Indian?s are abroad in various nations. By nature, Indian?s cross oceans for knowledge and wealth generations.

Q#Sir, you always say that we must dream big and follow our dreams. What makes one follow one’s own dreams? Parents, access or commitment?
A#Dreams are finally nothing but goals or mission in life. In my case I had great teachers in various phases of life. And also my parents, my father and mother were very useful teachers to me throughout their lives. I was the only fellow in the family studying, and their commitment to me was absolute. The spiritual environment at home shaped me.

Q#Sir, what is more important, the ability to handle failure or the ability to respond to failures?
A#Of course, I have myself gone through many successes and a few failures. And I have also met a number of successful people throughout the world wherever I have gone, and when I discuss with them, they reveal how many problems they have encountered, what kind of failures they have had.

Q#And the nation’s expectations were on you?
A#A lot of expectation. So then Prof.Satish Dhawan, the chairman saw my hesitation. He called me and gave me some advice, famous advice. He said, “Kalam, if you don’t do any work, you don’t experience any problem.” Even in media, if you don’t report there is no problem. If you report, problem starts.

Q#Sir, why do we find 2/3 of India’s engineering graduates unemployable? What do you think is the underlying problem?
A#During my recent visit to CanadaI visited a university called Waterloo. For an engineering degree students are taught in the classroom for one year, the next year they go to the industry. So two out of four years they spend in the industry. And in the industry they learn to work within the system, it may be the software system or the hardware system, machine system, electronic system, or chemical system. But they learn to apply what they studied at the university. So when they graduate there is good demand for them. They can hit the ground running.

Q#So, it is lack of integration between real-life work and academia that is the problem?
A#I want to share with you my own experience. In 1957 I studied aeronautical engineering in Madras Institute of Technology. It was a difficult discipline to get into and we were only nine students. Now, Prof. Srinivasan gave us a six months project in our final year. The project was to design low-level (low altitude, he clarifies) attack fighter aircraft. So, having studied, aerodynamics, structures, propulsion, control, etc., here we have to put them together into a workable aircraft system design. I was the project leader for that. I was the ninth, so eight other people are there, someone would give propulsion, some other aerodynamics etc. So, after four and-a-half-months of study, I was there in my laboratory. The teacher, my guide comes. At that time we did not have computers, I was using the design board for drawing the design of the aircraft and my friends were all around me. So, he comes and sees and says, “I’m completely disappointed with your work; I am going to stop your scholarship if you don’t complete the design in two weeks time.” (Dr Kalam laughs.) It was a very costly education, if my scholarship stopped, I had to return home. I talked all kinds of things, gave him excuses, told him we had worked so hard, all of us are suffering etc. But to no avail. And so, finally all of us joined together day and night, Saturdays, Sundays; we didn’t even go to our hostels. And we designed the fighter aircraft.

Q#Why, sir, is entrepreneurship and skill development very important to you?
A#We add seven million people every year at 10+2 level and three million graduates every year. So, we inject ten million people into the society every year as employment seekers. This is because entrepreneurship is not taught, either in the secondary school education or in higher education or university education. Entrepreneurship is not part of the curriculum, neither is acquisition of usable skills. That’s why I’m saying if 30 per cent people have to procure their skills, that training should be started during the period of education itself.

Q#What is your reaction to your selection as NDA nominee for President?
A#I am overwhelmed by the gesture. Being the President of India is an onerous task.

Q#Many say you are being made president because of your religion.
A#Really? To be honest I never thought of it that way at all. I have always regarded myself as an Indian.

Q#What sort of a role would you like to play?
A#For any president the major task is thinking of the best way to integrate the nation. While speaking to 3,000 children in Porbandar recently a young girl asked me what my message was to them. I told her that our minds should be embedded with thoughts of the nation and that the nation is always bigger than the individual. I think that message is relevant here too.

Q#Does being a scientist equip you in any way to perform your new duties?
A#No doubt, this will be a new type of mission. But essentially it is all about leadership and that is something we were trained for, even if the missions may have been different. We had a systems approach of careful analysis, design and integration that is relevant for any type of task. Also, we were not confined to conducting scientific research. We looked at the overall development of the nation.

Q#But you have never handled the intricacies of politics.
A#My own definition of politics is that it is all about creating leaders to evolve policies that will take the country to higher levels. It is a multi-dimensional leadership that focuses on the nation's economic, social and political development. If you look at politics through this perspective then everything falls into place.

Q#How do you view the current tensions between India and Pakistan?
A#I have not had time to study this thoroughly. All I would like to say at this moment is that India is a strong nation. That its strength doesn't come just from its weapons, but from its economic development and maturity in politics.

Q#As president you would have to do things you never really enjoyed doing-like dressing formally and hosting formal dinners. Are you ready to change?
A#(Laughs) Let us say it will be a new experience. Besides, you can achieve a lot of work even while having dinner.

Q#Dr. Kalam, you say the nation comes before the individual. What is your take on American business owners who have outsourced the jobs of their countrymen?
A#Every nation has to follow a certain policy: Commercial, trade, various other types of policies. The phenomenon of globalization is going on. If you consider the law of development, there are two types of nations. One category holds the developed nations, numbering less than 10, and the second category holds the hundreds of developing nations. Developed nations produce and market products in their own country and throughout the world. Only then can they survive as developed nations. Developing nations want to become developed nations. So, they have to produce products and competitively market them globally. So what is the commonality in the picture? Competitiveness! That is a key concept. Cost, quality, marketing — all make up factors of competitiveness. So, all nations have to work competitively, all nations have to depend on each other, work together. There’s nothing wrong in it.

Q#How do you envision the epic communal divide between Muslims and Hindus bridged in India?
A#Let me tell you a story. The Europeans fought with each other for hundreds of years. They even created two world wars. But today, we see that these same 23 nations have created the European Union. There are rich, not so rich, and poor nations in the EU, and all of them are working towards making Europeans live prosperous, happy lives. So, in India also such changes will happen, in fact throughout the whole world — the earlier the better. To give another example, U.S.A#and U.S.S.R., during the Cold War, generated 10,000 nuclear warheads. Today they are friends. They are saying they are working for world peace, they say they will bring down the number of nuclear warheads. So, historically, this cycle has to come to India too. Good things will happe

Q#You’ve been called the “Missile Man of India” and the “People’s President.” Is there an incongruity between your desire to empower the world with peace and making India a nuclear power?
A#I am innocent to the whole affair! I did not call myself these names! (laughs). When a nation is surrounded by weaponized nations, she has to equip herself. That’s what India has done. To make the nation peaceful and prosperous, we need minimum security. That’s what we have done.

Q#What was your immediate reaction when “Agni” and “Prithvi” missiles were successful?
A#I was right there and witnessed the whole thing. Courage is key. My message, especially to young people is to have courage to think differently, courage to invent, to travel the unexplored path, courage to discover the impossible and to conquer the problems and succeed. These are great qualities that they must work towards. This is my message to the young people.

Q#And who taught you this message?
A#Myself. I had to learn this myself. Literature also influenced me deeply. In India, we have a famous book called, Thirukkul, written 2,200 years back. I’ll quote a couplet: “If your thoughts are high, definitely you’re going to work for your aim, definitely you will succeed. But conversely, if you don’t have an aim, don’t have high thoughts, how can you aim at success?” My second favorite book is Light From Many Lamps, by (Lillian Eichler) Watson. And the third book that I love is Empire of the Mind. These three books have made my life.

Q#How did you feel when you realized that you didn’t have to support your family with your newspaper route anymore?
President Abdul Kalam shares a joke with anti apartheid icon Nelson Mandela during a visit to Johannesburg in 2004. 
A#I was the youngest member of my family, a student when World War II broke out. We were under the British rule at that time and the country was going through some tough times. But after the war ended, I didn’t have to sell newspapers anymore and life returned to normal again.

Q#How come you’re such a transparently sincere person?
A#See, I firmly believe that the nation has to be bigger than the individual and the individual has to work for the nation. If you’re working for yourself, you’ll not be transparent. But once you put the nation above you, you become transparent.

Q#Sir, on August 15, 1947, you were only 16 years old. Where were you on that particular day? How did people react in the streets? How did they celebrate the sudden freedom of India from the centuries old bondage of British rule?
A#Well, it’s a beautiful question. I was born in the small island town of Rameshwaram where I completed my primary school education in the Panchayat school. I went to a slightly bigger town 40 minutes away from Rameshwaram, for my high school studies. At that time only the great event took place for the nation. My teacher, Reverend Teri Solomon, told all of our class boys that they must attend the midnight celebration on 15th August 1947, in the quadrangle of the school.

Q#Mr. President, Dr. Rajendra Prasad was sworn in as the first President of India on January 26, 1950. Did you ever think then or later that you could someday become the President of India? Please share with our viewers your rise to the highest office in the nation; how did this all come about?
A#“Well, that dream was not there, not at all. My younger age dream was to fly, as inspired by my primary school teacher, Subramaniam Iyer. One day, he taught us how a bird flies. The way he taught us how a bird flies led me to want something to do with flight. Of course, he injected in me an ambition that I must fly in life. After my aeronautical degree, it was a disappointment that I was not selected by the Air Force. But then, I was fortunate that the space program got started by the visionary Dr. Vikram Sarabai then, and I was entrusted with the project for the design and development of the first satellite launch vehicle for the country.

Q#Why the students have to face partiality in the schools?
A#That is a part of growing up.

Q#How can we stop the black hole from further deepening in Antarctica?
A#You mean the Ozone Hole. We can attempt to reduce the Ozone Hole by reducing the emissions of chlorofluorocarbons into the atmosphere.

Q#When we know that space is infinite what is the use of exploring space?
A#We explore space in the spirit of inquiry to expand our knowlede.

Q#In case of nuclear energy reactors, energy is definitely released in a greats amount but on the other hand it is deteriorating the ecological balance as it is causing a lot of pollution. So why not we concentrate more on the renewable resources and invent such techniques and instruments so that we can make the best possible use of these resources.
A#Research and development is going on into renewable resources. However nuclear energy technology has improved over the years and it is no longer as dangerous as it was thought to be many years ago.

Q#After the successful mission of India's first space capsule, SRE-I, how much time will it take for India to develop space shuttles like NASA.
A#We are doing very well in space technology and are capable of the most things. ISRO is doing a good job and we can do almost anything that other space going countries are capable of doing, including re-usable spacecraft.

Q#How economically viable, a manned mission to Moon would be for a developing country like India? Apart from putting India on the international space map, what other benefits can India derive from India?
A#Space science has a lot of spin offs which benefit a society. The Moon has helium 3 which is a future source of energy. These are the benefits.

Q#A scientist and then converted to President. Do you think can bring a new era in a country like India? If yes, then how?
A#I am working for a developed India and smiles on the faces of a billion people.

Q#Do we really need to view everything from a scientific side for proper understanding?
A#Yes. Science is the only way man can progress fast.

Q#There are many shortcomings of science, which has compelled people to think:
Is science a boon or bane?
Is it a blessing or a curse?
So, what are the ways to reduce these shortcomings?
A#Science is innocent. It is certainly not a bane. It is how it used by man that makes it a blessing or a curse. For example nuclear energy can be used for generation of electricity or also for making bombs.

Q#Where do you see India 20 years from now in the field of science and technology?
A#Youth is the greatest resource on the Earth, under the Earth and above the Earth. This is a tremendous resource for the Nation. Our youth will help is in becoming very accomplished in science and technology.

Q#When can India think of sending a man to the Moon in its own rocket?
A#ISRO is already working on this and by the next few years this will be possible.

Q#What is the future of space science in India after the development of the cryogenic stage in rockets?
A#India is developing re-entry technology so that it can progress to putting an astronaut into space and returning him/her back to Earth safely. In 2008, the Chandrayan Space Craft will orbit the Moon and land a payload there for scientific experiments.

Q#There are various satellites revolving around the Earth. Recently, China destroyed its old satellite and its debris may cause to other satellites. Don't you think that there must be an international union to discuss such destruction as this can trigger a change reaction?
A#Warfare in space should not be encouraged as space belongs to everyone.

Q#What is your outlook on the superstitions and religious beliefs in India over the advancing pace of science and technology?
A#As education spreads and prosperity increases, people will appreciate the importance of having scientific thinking. As a result, superstitions will slowly become less. Religious beliefs in the form of spiritualism are not bad.

Q#Upto what extent has science and technology been able to spread awareness in the remote villages of India. Jawahar Lal Nehru said India will progress if its villages will progress?
A#There is good scope to increase awareness about various things in rural areas, which can help in development. Science and technology is providing the means of spreading this awareness.

Q#We have so many meetings in all fields. Why are we not making anti corruption meeting. It is the only issue, making India is a developing country for so many years. But I want to see India as a developed country. Please conduct conferences on corruption. Then rural people can know what suffering is.
A#Know law or conferences can end corruption. Righteousness and enlightened citizenship can end this problem. Our children have the weapon of love, to convince those in their families who are corrupt especially corrupt mother and father to change their ways. The youth must take this up as a mission.

Q#As we all know the Brahmos Missile which is made by the help of Russia and India. How would it help in self-defence?
A#The Brahmos Missile is the product of joint collaboration between India and Russia, where the core competences of the two nations were brought together for a worldclass product. It is a supersonic cruise missile which can be launched from multiple platforms and therefore can be of use in the nation's defence.

Q#What do we mean by space stations and space labs?
A#Space stations are orbiting structures in space, which Orbit the earth at a certain altitude. Space labs are laboratories in space aboard the space stations or space vehicle in which experiments in zero gravity are conducted.

Q#In our education system today, students are going towards theoretical things instead of practical thought. As a student and Scientists, how did you tackle it and overcome this thought?
A#Luckily I had a good teacher in Class V in Rameshwaram. His name was Siva Subramanya Iyer. He took care to also show us the theory in action, therefore, practical examples.

Q#You are the champion in nuclear physics. I want to ask you why are we making missiles, which have more harm than benefit. India is a great country, which has a great and powerful army. So far defensive purpose we can use the power of our army. Is the purpose to make missiles only to increase the grace of India in the world?
A#With our neighbourhood having nuclear weapons, we cannot sit in Tapas.

Q#What role can we play towards progress and prosperity of the country?
A#As students, you must study hard and excel in your work for good future. Also, you can do two other things. Plant five saplings in your neighbourhood, go to the surrounding villages if you are living in a city and teach five people how to read and write in your spare time.

Q#How can Science help in helping the betterment of human life?
A#Science can translate research into applications thus bringing costs down of things, which can be of practical use for the common person, especially those in rural areas.

Q#Why are we forgiving Pakistan, as they sent terrorists to India?
A#We want an environment of external peace so that our economic development is fast so that our people living below the poverty line can get a good life. Peace in South Asia will also benefit the region as a whole. Poverty is our common enemy.

Q#Do you agree that the time has come now to eradicate our nuclear weapons?
A#With our neighbourhood having nuclear weapons, we cannot sit in Tapas. When others remove their nuclear weapons, we will also do so. Our nuclear weapons are for self defense and not first use.

Q#Why are we not getting Nobel Prizes since such a long time?
A#I am sure that once again this will happen in the future.

Q#How can interest, if basic sciences be revived in India?
A#My Government is working towards making high school students interested in pursuing a career in basic sciences as a life long career.

Q#What according to policy maker of India should be done to retain talent in our country? That is to stop brain drain?
A#My personal opinion is, there is no brain drain. Even if, a few person of our students go abroad every year, we still have thousands of other who are equally competent. Indians who go abroad are a benefit to us, as they retain their umbilical connectivity with their motherland.

Q#I want to say that people are going to Science stream and want to become a Doctor, but this reservation system for OBC/SC/ST was done. Do you think that it is right to give reservation to those students? You can provide education to them at primary and secondary level, but do you think giving reservations is right?
A#When the number of institutes of higher education increase, then the question of reservations will become irrelevant. I am working for that.

Q#When we are depressed during our work then how can we motivate ourselves and again restart to achieve our goal?
A#If you do know work, you will have no problems. If you do work, you will face problems. You must not allow the problem to be your master, but you must master the problem.

Q#The environment is changing rapidly like global warning, deficit of water and crops are almost susceptible for this. What will be the happen to the food security of India?
A#In the future, Indian Agriculture faces three challenges. Less land, less farmers and less water to produce more food for more people. Our Scientists will take the help of technology to find the solution.

Q#How do you visualize yourself, as the President, as well as an expert scientist?
A#Wherever I have been, I have worked hard and sweated. I am trying to market the idea of the developed India by 2020.

Q#How can we produce the energy if coal, gas etc run out? What are the other forms of energy towards which we are working for?
A#Research is on various other sources. Sources like solar energy, bio-fuels and hydrogen energy.

Q#What are the current states of Nuclear Energy in India and is it sufficient?
A#Our aim is to increase Nuclear Energy production for electricity as far as possible and we are well on the way.

Q#What will be the fuel for future generations when all the conventional sources of energy will exhaust?
A#Sources like solar energy, bio-fuels and hydrogen energy.

Q#As we know that in some developed countries electricity is being generated by converting waste materials into energy. What is being done in this matter in our country where majority of our villagers go without electricity even today?
A#There are some such projects, which have been undertakan on a small scale, for example in Andhra Pradesh. I am trying to push this idea. It will not only be able to provide electricity but also take care of the solid waste in our cities.

Q#India is an agriculture dominated country. To feed the increasing population, there is over exploitation of natural resources like soil and water. Can joining hands with Europe, solve the problem to meet the food requirement of increasing population keeping in view conservation of soil and water?
A#Conservation of soil and water is important. In the future there will lesser land and lesser water which will have to produce more food for our growing population and also in increasing buying power of the people. We can think of joint research amongst the many other possibilities, but keeping in mind Indian conditions.

Q#Should not we increase the number of medical professionals in India, in comparison to basic scientists because if we see health conditions in rural areas are too bad because of lack of awareness and unavailability of doctors.
A#We need both in large numbers. Scientists for research into basic science and then applying the research for practical daily needs of our people, especially in the rural areas. We also need good doctors in large numbers, but they must serve in the rural areas also.

Q#In many of the Hydroelectric projects carried out in the North East India faces water scarcity at the time of completion of it ? Again River inter-linking is a very big project. What to do now? To skip or to continue it?
A#River Linking is an important project and will benefit the country. Already some work is in progress in Madhya Pradesh to link to small rivers. It shall be an important infrastructure project for our young people.

Q#How the poor villagers can contribute towards the controlling of global warming?
A#By using eco friendly methods. Most of them are already following a life style which is eco friendly.

Q#What is the role of scientist to the society in general?
A#Scientiest should work for the welfare of society, that is the application of their work for the benefit of the common person and especially for people in rural areas.

Q#Science is simply law of nature and about the nature. But science and technology is destroying the beauty of nature as we know that ozone is depleting, global warming increasing day by day. What do you think about this. I think it is not science and technology's use but misuse of it.
A#Science and Technology is innocent. It can be used for both positive and negative purposes. Science and Technology has led to development and that in turn has at times damaged our environment. But, let us not forget that the solutions to this problem are also provided by science and technology.

Q#How can science and technology feed a poor hungry human being?
A#Science and Technology can provide the means for doing things in a cheaper and more efficient way. Science and Technology has led to increase in agriculture yields etc.

Q#How can quality of life be improved through science and technology?
A#Nuclear science has allowed us to irradiate seeds for agricultural purposes and this has helped in the process of food production. There are many such examples.

Q#Most of the poor parents are compelled to use their children as anti-poverty weapon by putting them into child labour and thus making the legislation less effective. I want to ask that what measure would you like to suggest to make the present legislation more effective to poor parents as well?
A#It has been found in many states that the Mid Day Meal scheme in schools has helped retain children in class. This is the way out.

Q#"The cycle in nature are capable of restoring the balance and evolution is the continuous process", then why should we worry so much for the conservation of nature?
A#Nature gives back to us as much as we give to it, therefore as much as we respect it. We need to be worried because we are taking much more from nature than what we are giving it back.

Q#Mr. President don't you feel that the tapping the Natural Source of energy more advantageous than Nuclear Reactors as they are the source of hazardous waste?
A#Nuclear energy is no longer as dangerous in terms of waster material as it used to be about 20 to 30 years ago. Technology has progressed to make it safer.

Q#There had been great mathematicians in the early time from India and from rest of the world like Ramanujam and Aryabhat etc. But recently there had been no such thumping person. Is the work in mathematics declining in India and other parts of the world?
A#There is no decline in mathematics around the world in my opinion. In fact recently Mr. John Nash a Nobel Laureate who got the award in the field of Mathematics was in India.

Q#India is a developing country what development would you make to stand at Ist position in the world of science and technology.
A#Making more youngsters interested in science as a life long career and increase in number of higher institutions of learning teaching subjects related to science and technology.

Q#Fossil fuels like petroleum and coal took millions of years to be formed and now with the rapid pace with which they are being used they will disappear in few years. Other sources of energy like solar power, nuclear power, hydro power are still being developed. So, are we prepared for the time when we will have no fossil fuels?
A#Yes we are prepared for that time. Work and research is going on about alternate renewable fuels and energy.

Q#It is usually said that solar cookers should be used but Sir, I cannot see any solar cookers in the market. How can people have access to them?
A#Solar cooker's can be used for cooking certain types of foods. They are available in shops run by the Government.

Q#India is a hot country. Don?t you think that a strong appreciation is needed to develop green power in the country? For that individual to individual effort is necessary. Do you think that a common Indian is committed to contribute to the country?s green power?
A#Let us not look to the next person. If each one contributes then the sum will be large. Let?s not wait for others to make the start. Lot of research is going on in the field of green energy in India and there is positive development.

Q#What is Science and Technology in your view?
A#The process of using ones brain to find answers to the phenomena around us ? that is science and technology is the process of using science to develop ways to answer those questions.

Q#Young scientists have so many dreams but they can?t put into action due to lack of opportunities available. Only few can enter into world of science due to less no of seats in Universities.
A#As the number of institutions of higher education increase, this will no longer be a problem.

Q#What is more of yourself?? A scientist or President of India?
A#A teacher.

Q#What are the steps I have to take to become a rocket scientist?
A#Study hard and excel in your Boards by taking PCM combination. After that take admission for aeronautical engineering in a good college.

Q#What is the scope of nano-technology in our daily life?
A#Nano-technology is the frontier technology of the future. Carbon Nano-tubes will make solar cells more efficient thus making solar power in our homes in the future a cheap source of energy. In the same way nano-technology will help make cheaper cure in medicines etc.

Q#Why don't we have our Indian scientist achieving glory in space as scientist of Indian origin like Sunita Williams?
A#The ISRO is working to put a an Indian into space in the long term. I am sure that it will happen.

Q#As science develops new technology pollution is increasing. Is there any work going on to control pollution?
A#Work is going on around the world to develop alternative clean energy technologies to reduce dependence on fossil fuels which are renewable.

Q#Every now and then we come to know that India will be ahead of USA by 2045. May I know during this span of time USA will be sitting idle and there will be no further development in USA?
A#India will be one of the top three economies of the world by around 2045 based on size. The USA will continue to be the largest economy based on size even then. The USA will not stop to develop its economy but India?s speed of economic development is expected to be faster and thus it will reach the third position based on size of its economy.

Q#Can we develop such a software which could restrict our confidential areas like defence and administration which are easily accessible on sites like googleearth.com?
A#Definitely there can be.

Q#Till now crores have been spent in improving the Yamuna River, but till now no improvement has been seen. What is the reason?
A#What is required is a mission mode approach with defined targets and determination.

Q#Is Vigyan an opponent of Dharma?
A#No. Science and religion are not opponents. While science tries to find solutions to the problems of human society, religion attempts also to do the same.

Q#What will be our future after being a scientist, because it takes a lot of years for a person to get profits and sometimes his experiments are identified after his death?
A#Those who take up a career as scientists and research into pure science are not attracted by profits but by the challenge of science and passion.

Q#If any good person don't want to be a political leader then what will future of India be?
A#We need good people to enter politics.

Q#Are there some sites where we can learn and clear our concepts in science?
A#The Ministry of Human Resource Development (HRD) has recently launched a very good e-learning site called SAKSHAT.

Q#When will e-education start in India?
A#E-education has already started in India in many places. India is one of the few countries in the world to have a dedicated satellite in space dedicated to e-education. It is called EDUSAT.

Q#How can a government leave people helpless after displacing them or offering them jobs for which they are not trained? How can science help such people who are displaced by developmental project?
A#Science and technology can be used to teach them skills or upgrade their skills and thus make such people fit to take up new jobs and vocations.

Q#What is the role of science in solving social issues & dealing with inequalities?
A#Science and technology has a role but not the only role. Science and technology can bring solutions to the problems of the poor to their door steps and at a cheap price, thus reducing their problems and in many cases increasing their incomes, thus reducing inequalities

Q#Can traits like honesty, respect to elders, self discipline be produced by science and technology?
A#All these traits cannot be produced by science technology, but by upbringing by the mother and the father and the influence of good teachers in the primary school. Also, environment also plays an important role.

Q#Sir, why can?t we do a survey in rural areas to come to know what and how they want to learn and take education for them from, much more than Mid Day Meal?
A#The Mid Day Meal scheme has proved to be successful wherever it has been implemented, as it helps keep children in schools, as most of the parents of such children are poor and cannot afford their mid day meals. If they had not been given mid day meals they would have been taken away to the fields to work with their parents thus losing out on education.

Q#The present Indian education system makes science only theoretical which is miles apart from practical surroundings. Our minds are bound to think within the walls of theories. How can our minds be let free to flow in creativity by the change in education system?
A#It is not true that our educational system is only such that students are taught within the walls of theory. Wherever there are good teachers, they teach both theory supplemented by practical knowledge. However I do agree that our education system need change in the age group 5 to 12 where it needs to emphasise more on creativity. I am working to reduce the burden of heavy bags loaded with books in this age group.

Q#Why can't we promote our budding talent to scale heights as Indian scientists besides scientists of Indian origin as Sunita Williams?
A#I am suggesting the establishment of a permanent cadre of scientists selected from students from Post Graduate level, who would be provided life long job security to pursue careers in pure science. That way we can promote our own young science talent.

Q#What are you doing to bring the ISRO to the level of NASA?
A#The ISRO is already an international level organization. Dr. Madhavan Nair the Chairman of the ISRO is already steering the organization to a new level, with the successful return of the satellite which went into space and returned successfully. This has proved our re-entry technology. In 2008 India shall be sending the Chandrayan spacecraft to the Moon and landing a payload.

Q#There are some diseases which are genetic and are inherited by the child from the parent(s) through their genes. So can we develop such a technology which can change the gene during pregnancy?
A#There is research going on Chennai on this. Efforts are one to identify the genes which can cause certain diseases to develop in a child after growing up, so that they can be changed in the pregnancy stage itself.

Q#Why don?t teachers motivate students by telling the stories of scientists to make them think in the way scientists thought before they proposed their theory that we are studying today?
A#Definitely teachers can motivate their students by telling them about famous people such as scientists. When I was studying at St. Joseph?s College in Trichy, once a week the senior teacher used to give us a class of about one hour about one famous personality. This used to be called the moral science class. Schools can take this up today.

Q#Is it the examination system which makes our teachers to apply hands tied approach to science education? How can it be made more interesting?
A#Good teachers have a passion to teach and they can make any subject interesting and any student interested in the subject. There is a lack of good teachers these days. That makes tele-education very important as it will benefit students at various locations as one good teacher in a particular subject will teach them.

Q#Why don't teachers teach with so much of interest that students enjoy their studies more than their sports? Is it because of heavy syllabus? If this is the reason then what are we gaining from heavy syllabus?
A#Good teachers have a passion to teach and they can make any subject interesting and any student interested in the subject. There is a lack of good teachers these days. That makes tele-education very important as it will benefit students at various locations as one good teacher in a particular subject will teach them.

Q#I want to know that what you feel difference in post of Indian President and as a scientist of DRDO according to your experience?
A#In both posts one has to put in hard work, in that sense there is no difference in the two posts.

Q#Can traits like honesty, respect to elders, self discipline be produced by science and technology?
A#All these traits cannot be produced by science technology, but by upbringing by the mother and the father and the influence of good teachers in the primary school. Also, environment also plays an important role.

Q#Sir, you always say that we must dream big and follow our dreams. What makes one follow one’s own dreams? Parents, access or commitment?
A#Dreams are finally nothing but goals or mission in life. In my case I had great teachers in various phases of life. And also my parents, my father and mother were very useful teachers to me throughout their lives. I was the only fellow in the family studying, and their commitment to me was absolute. The spiritual environment at home shaped me. You should convert your goals and mission to success in spite of problems. That is my lifelong commitment.

Q#Sir, what is more important, the ability to handle failure or the ability to respond to failures?
A#Of course, I have myself gone through many successes and a few failures. And I have also met a number of successful people throughout the world wherever I have gone, and when I discuss with them, they reveal how many problems they have encountered, what kind of failures they have had. So, I have come to the conclusion that great success has some element of failure also. I still remember Prof. Satish Dhawan, he gave me a project in 1973, were you born then?

Q#I was born in ’73.
A#He gave me the SLV project in 1973, and named me the project director. I found that there were a lot of senior people above me, you know, experienced people, they should support me and there were a number of youngsters with high technical knowledge. So, I had to bring them all together to succeed. At that time I was in my thirties, 39 or 40. So, I was frightened, whether I can do it. It’s a great job, how can I do it for the first time, how to build a rocket, to make a satellite, and it’s a big vision and how can I do it?

Q#And the nation’s expectations were on you?
A#A lot of expectation. So then Prof.Satish Dhawan, the chairman saw my hesitation. He called me and gave me some advice, famous advice. He said, “Kalam, if you don’t do any work, you don’t experience any problem.” Even in media, if you don’t report there is no problem. If you report, problem starts. (He laughs heartily at this). So, Prof. Dhawan said major programmes are always coupled with major problems. But don’t allow problems to become your captain, you should become the captain of the problem. Defeat the problem and succeed. This advice he gave me in 1973, even now it’s true. It is true for politicians, educationists, media people, it’s true in every area. So, the message I’m giving is we should take control of the problems, okay? 

Q#Sir, why do we find 2/3 of India’s engineering graduates unemployable? What do you think is the underlying problem?
A#During my recent visit to CanadaI visited a university called Waterloo. For an engineering degree students are taught in the classroom for one year, the next year they go to the industry. So two out of four years they spend in the industry. And in the industry they learn to work within the system, it may be the software system or the hardware system, machine system, electronic system, or chemical system. But they learn to apply what they studied at the university. So when they graduate there is good demand for them. They can hit the ground running.

Q#So, it is lack of integration between real-life work and academia that is the problem?
A#I want to share with you my own experience. In 1957 I studied aeronautical engineering in Madras Institute of Technology. It was a difficult discipline to get into and we were only nine students. Now, Prof. Srinivasan gave us a six months project in our final year. The project was to design low-level (low altitude, he clarifies) attack fighter aircraft. So, having studied, aerodynamics, structures, propulsion, control, etc., here we have to put them together into a workable aircraft system design. I was the project leader for that. I was the ninth, so eight other people are there, someone would give propulsion, some other aerodynamics etc. So, after four and-a-half-months of study, I was there in my laboratory. The teacher, my guide comes. At that time we did not have computers, I was using the design board for drawing the design of the aircraft and my friends were all around me. So, he comes and sees and says, “I’m completely disappointed with your work; I am going to stop your scholarship if you don’t complete the design in two weeks time.” (Dr Kalam laughs.) It was a very costly education, if my scholarship stopped, I had to return home. I talked all kinds of things, gave him excuses, told him we had worked so hard, all of us are suffering etc. But to no avail. And so, finally all of us joined together day and night, Saturdays, Sundays; we didn’t even go to our hostels. And we designed the fighter aircraft. On a Sunday evening Prof. Srinivasan came, exactly one day before the deadline. He saw the design, he was very happy. Then, he gave us Madras coffee in his house. (Dr. Kalam laughs again as he remembers). It taught me the value of planning, of teamwork, of time. But what we learned most out of that is that in the education system, while we study mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, chemical engineering etc. we should also have a clear understanding of how it all fits into a larger system, a productive system. So students must also be taught system design, system integration, system management, since that is what the industry wants. Our educational system should promote that.

Q#Why, sir, is entrepreneurship and skill development very important to you?
A#We add seven million people every year at 10+2 level and three million graduates every year. So, we inject ten million people into the society every year as employment seekers. This is because entrepreneurship is not taught, either in the secondary school education or in higher education or university education. Entrepreneurship is not part of the curriculum, neither is acquisition of usable skills. That’s why I’m saying if 30 per cent people have to procure their skills, that training should be started during the period of education itself.

Q#Sir, what would be three qualities which you think one requires for success in life?
A#I will say four qualities, okay. Number one, a clear aim in life, without it you will be going in all directions. Second, you should acquire the knowledge. You acquire knowledge in multiple ways. Great books should be your friend, great teachers should be a friend, and even home environment and parents can help you gain knowledge. The third aspect is hard work with devotion. I am saying since your work is towards your mission, it should be permeated with the devotion to that mission you have in mind. And the fourth one is perseverance. Persevere continuously. You do these four things and you can become anything. All these four things you have, work for it, you will achieve anything.

Q#Sir, would you then say, that it finally boils down to focusing on one mission in life?
A#No, it is finally that the goal should be in front of you. That is my experience. We are always tempted to do many things simultaneously. But if you start doing one thing, have one goal and put all your efforts into that, then definitely you will succeed. Of course, you have to win! A problem always appears here and there but you have to face the problem and defeat the problem.

Q#Sir, how do we, at Careers360 add better value for our readers?
A#You should not become just like any other magazine. You see 700 million people are living in the rural area, you are reporting about 300 million people. So you should report the success story of a fisherman, an agrofood processor, a farmer, a craftsman. The message is become the magazine of a billion people population.

Q#Sir, one last word to our readers.
A#They must think in a big way. I remember 2000 years back, there is a famous saying in Thirukural by Saint Poet Thiruvalluvar — Vellathanaythu Malar Neetam Mandartham Ullathanaytu Uyarvu. It means that, just like the height of the water in a pond determines the height to which a lily would grow, it is the heights of thoughts that determines the heights to which you could aspire for. So as human beings they should have great thoughts, great aims, and when thoughts become transformed into actions performed with perseverance and devotion, success has to follow. Thank you very much sir.

Q#Would it be correct to say that every book of yours is, in a sense, an autobiography?
A#My experiences are somehow integrated with people's experiences. For me there are two types of people: The young and the experienced. So, you will find that in every book, I have narrated certain experiences from my life. Thousands of people have written to tell me how Wings of Fire, Ignited Minds and Indomitable Spirit have touched their hearts and made a difference in their lives. That is the greatest satisfaction for me.

Q#Which is the experience you would consider the most negative you have written about?
A#For me, there is no such thing as a negative experience. But I have faced problems. Two instances come to mind. My first experience of professional failure occurred in 1979, when a satellite carrier failed to launch. But I never allowed failure to become my captain. I also learned from observing some remarkable people. Instead of blaming me, my boss at the time accepted the entire responsibility for the failure of the project in front of 120 mediapersons. When I succeeded the next year, he did not take the credit and instead asked me to address a press conference. That leadership quality-in failure, having the ability to take the blame for your team, and sharing in their successis a lesson I learned very early in life. Years later, when I became president and was presented the Office of Profit Bill, I felt there was a problem. I asked Parliament to reconsider. Of course there was a lot of controversy regarding my stance... a Standing Committee had to be set up to study the matter, but I stuck to my beliefs.

Q#You've observed life at the level of the common man, then later as a professional and in the last 10 years or so, you have watched India at the highest levels of political leadership. Do you find any leader today with the capacity to take the blame and share the success?
A#No... Look at this photo. I call it "political grace". It was taken in 2002 when my name was nominated by both Vajpayeeji and Soniaji... It shows all the political leaders together.

Q#So what happened to your name this time?
A#Well, no one proposed it. Of course there were discussions in political parties but I haven't been nominated. Some people asked me to contest and I told them I would announce my decision at the right time, which I did.

Q#But Mamata Banerjee and Mulayam Singh Yadav proposed your name.
A#It was proposed and withdrawn too!

Q#So what did you think of Mulayam Singh's withdrawal?
A#I don't know. But I have written a letter to Mamata in which I have praised her leadership qualities.

Q#Leadership qualities?
A#Yes, because she was close to the golden throne. If she had worked through (with) the system she would have got whatever she wanted or at least half. But she took a stand and lost that opportunity. Of course she can recover her position. But she has the courage of a leader. Who must also have vision.

Q#Do you think Mamata Banerjee has vision?
A#Let me define a leader. He must have vision and passion and not be afraid of any problem. Instead, he should know how to defeat it. Most importantly, he must work with integrity.

Q#And a leader should not change his mind in 24 hours!
A# I can only define a leader. I can't give you any examples!

Q#The whole country has been watching this political drama (presidential election).
A#During the Mamata and Mulayam press conference, I was in Bihar as editor for a day for Prabhat Khabar. I told the newspaper 10 days earlier that if they want me to edit their paper, the first page must contain a thought that makes people smile and feature success stories of a farmer, fisherman, politician or anyone else. The paper showed me 20 success stories out of which I selected four and also contributed a poem I had written for the youth of Bihar.

Q# If you had to write a poem about this presidential election, what would be the first line?
A#Courage, courage, courage.

Q#But nobody showed any courage! Is that an appeal?
A# I'm proposing in Parliament that parties should devote more time to developmental politics. If one party promises to eradicate poverty in 10 years, another party should challenge it and promise to create economic prosperity.

Q#It is said that a day before you released a statement saying you would not contest the presidential polls, you had prepared a statement outlining the reasons why you would be a candidate. Including that you would be a "people's candidate", not a party's candidate. Is that true?
A#At no time did I prepare any such statement.

Q#Did you consider yourself a candidate? Or tell anyone privately?
A#No, no. I received a lot of calls from various leaders asking me to contest and asking if I would agree to stand for election if I was nominated.

Q#Did Mr Advani call you?
A#Yes, a number of people called.

Q#Did Mamata Banerjee call you? Mulayam Singh?
A#Yes, all of them called me and asked me to stand. Many of them had doubts about whether I would stand.

Q#So finally, you took the decision not to contest based on the fact that you didn't have sufficient numbers.
A#Not only that. (Points at a photo on the table.) This photograph will reveal a graceful political system. I dream of that and will work for that.

Q#But this photo is invalid because the Congress consciously never accepted your name this time.
A#I want you to understand from this photograph, taken in 2002, how the political system should work-politicians must work together for the good of the nation.

Q#Were they able to work together because Atal Bihari Vajpayee was then prime minister?
A#Yes, leadership counts. A leader is a visionary, a missionary. He is not afraid of any problem, does not follow anyone but makes his own path.

Q#You make a fairly bland statement that you were surprised Mrs Gandhi did not stake her claim (to become PM in 2004). If we revisit that period, what happened during the first meeting you had with Mrs Gandhi and Dr Manmohan Singh?
A#After they (the Congress) won the elections, no one from the party came to meet me for at least three days. As they were the single largest party, I called Mrs Gandhi and asked her to meet me. She arrived with Dr Manmohan Singh and said that the party had decided to make him the prime minister. If you remember, at the time many parties were against Mrs Gandhi becoming PM, despite the Supreme Court giving her the go-ahead. I had also received several letters against her becoming PM which I had forwarded to the government (the Congress).

Q#So what was the government's response?
A#No, no, government doesn't reply

Q#Subramanian Swamy has said it was his intervention; he had raised the issue of citizenship. Then there were sms campaigns against Mrs Gandhi becoming PM.
A#Besides Mr Swamy, many other parties and individuals also wrote to me. We have to remember that after all those campaigns a judicial judgment was taken. After the Supreme Court announced that Mrs Gandhi could become PM, how could I supersede it?

Q#Then what stopped her from staking claim to the PM's post?
A#That only Mrs Gandhi knows.

Q#Did you meet Mr Vajpayee after he was defeated?
A#A number of times. He took the defeat in his stride. That's another example of leadership qualities. I remember when Narasimha Rao was PM, I was his scientific adviser for the atomic energy programme. Just before the 1996 elections, Rao told me, "I'm going to Tirupati, stand by for nuclear tests." Success seemed assured and he wanted to celebrate with a nuclear test. Unfortunately, he lost. Soon after, I got a call from both victor and vanquished; they wanted to meet me. Rao asked me to brief the new PM on the nuclear programme. Where matters of the country were concerned, work would go on. Nation is bigger than political party.

Q#There is a famous story that you were blessed by Swami Sivananda in your youth.
A#As a child I wanted to be a pilot. So when I grew up, I applied to the Indian Air Force and was called for an interview to Dehradun. For 10 days I was put through a series of gruelling tests and then I found out I had failed the medical test. Despondent, I left Dehradun and on the banks of the Ganga, I saw Swami Sivananda surrounded by thousands of devotees. I sat in the last row. A little later he beckoned me and a French tourist and blessed us and gave us vishwaroopam, what Lord Krishna gave Arjun to dispel all his fears. When I returned to Delhi, a job was waiting for me: Senior scientific adviser in the Ministry of Defence.

Q#In the book, you mention that you do the morning namaaz.
A#Yes, every day, whenever possible. My father was very strict about namaaz and would wake me up at 4 a.m. and take me to the mosque. I also fast.

Q#So why is it that the so-called Muslim leaders in the North always have the feeling that you are not a practising Muslim?
A#First of all, I am an Indian and try to be a good human being. People can call me XYZ, that's their freedom of expression. There is no conflict of any kind regarding my faith in Islam. I often visit temples and churches as well. God is everywhere.

Q#You had several conversations with Vajpayee when he was PM. In your own assessment, do you consider Modi guilty of the Gujarat riots?
A#I'm not there to pronounce a judgment on the Gujarat riots; that's the work of the judiciary. But I will narrate another incident about Vajpayee. When he took over the Cabinet, I was scientific adviser. He called me to his office one night and offered me a Cabinet post. I was busy with the Agni and nuclear programme. The next morning I went back to meet him. He sat in his room, surrounded by trays of sweets, which were a weakness of his. I told him I was sorry but I couldn't become a minister as my work on the two programmes would suffer. Later, I finished work on the programmes, left the government and went back to teaching. It was then that Vajpayee called me and asked me to become president.

Q#Do you think Vajpayee considered Modi guilty of the riots?
A#I can't speak for him. Whether the riots were planned or just happened, we don't know but any right-thinking individual would not support any wrong being done to a community. When I visited Gujarat, I did not go to investigate what happened and whether Modi was right or wrong, but to remove the pain and accelerate relief work.

Q#There is a controversy over whether Modi can be a prime ministerial candidate. What is your view?
A#It doesn't matter what I think. We are a democratic country; the people of India will decide.

Q#Between Nitish Kumar and Modi, who would make a better PM?
A#Don't drag me into a controversy! I know both of them very well and they are good friends.

Q#You just met Nitish Kumar...
A#Yes, we discussed the presidential elections. He told me I had a lot of support within the NDA but did not have the numbers to win.

Q#So you took his advice and decided not to contest.
A#I also relied on my conscience. Conscience is my king.

Q#Yet you put your conscience aside during the Bihar Assembly polls when the PM spoke to you and said the government would fall.
A#The Bihar governor had sent the PM a note stating the Assembly was not functioning at all and the state government was in chaos. The PM called me in Moscow and said the situation had reached crisis point. He asked me for my views and said he had called a Cabinet meeting. I did some research of my own and then the PM called back in an hour and relayed the Cabinet's decision. So I took an informed decision.

Q#But you write in your book that you almost resigned.
A#Almost. Because the judiciary believed I took the decision sitting in Moscow, unaware that I was receiving up-to-the-minute information. They found fault with the governor, so I felt I should resign. But the vice-president was away on tour so there was a gap of a few hours before I could inform him. In that time period, I met the PM and we had a long chat during which he convinced me not to resign in the interest of the nation. So I didn't.

Q#But so many people use that as an excuse to continue in office.
A#Not me. Why should I cling to power? What will I gain by becoming the president again? I don't need anything from anybody.

Q#Corruption is one of the most serious threats facing our nation today. If you were prime minister, would you pass the Lokpal bill?
A#Corruption is a continuous process (laughs). There is no doubt that Anna (Hazare) is fighting for an important cause. But if the Lokpal bill is passed, it will just serve to fill up all our jails. Instead, I propose another movement for the youth (below 35) called "What can I give". It has just three components: Make your mother happy, make your father free from corruption and work towards saving the environment by planting trees. Anna heard about my idea and said it will take a long time to bear fruit but his mechanical process will only end up filling jails, while people's minds and hearts remain unchanged.

Q#Anna Hazare says 15 ministers are corrupt. How much corruption did you see while in government?
A#I didn't calculate

Q#What are the objectives of India's missile development programme, the agni mission?
A#To design and develop missiles for the three services and concurrently enter the production phase.

Q#What is the Agni mission?
A#It aims at the design and development of important technologies like the heat shield which has to withstand the intense heat generated when the missile re-enters the earth's atmosphere and the control and guidance system required to make sure the missile carries the payload to its target.

Q#Has this been achieved?
A#We are delighted that all the sub-systems worked well as part of an integrated missile. We are also thrilled that the multiple tracking system networked with the Interim Test Range at Bal sore was a success.

Q#What does the launch mean to India?
A#It gives us the confidence that we are capable of designing any kind of missile. We are now self-sufficient both in design and missile technology.

Q#What are its capabilities?
A#It can carry payloads of 1,000 kg and less as far as 2,500 km and heavier payloads up to 1,500 km.

Q#Why does India need this capability?
A#It is a technological strength. Strength respects strength. Weaklings are not honoured. So we should be strong.

Q#Is Agni capable of carrying nuclear warheads?
A#It can carry conventional warheads. It can also carry flowers to offer as a symbol of peace (laughs). It can also carry nuclear warheads. In India we are not making nuclear warheads. We provide the carrier and the policy makers decide how to use it.

Q#What caused the last-minute hold on April 20 and May 1?
A#The first time it was held because we were trying to get familiar with the networking to track the missile. The stoppage during the second launch operation was due to the bursting of a pressure valve.

Q#When will the second Agni be tested? How many more are to follow?
A#The second will be in less than a year and there are plans for two more.

Q#How long will it take to reach the production phase?
A#We have tried to mesh the development and production phases unlike in the case of the older research and development programmes. Agni's production phase can begin in less than five years.

Q#Is Agni India's ultimate answer to China's DF-3 which also has a range of 2,500 km?
A#I cannot answer that question. Our business is to provide a capability and it is up to policy makers to decide what they want to do with this carrier.

Q#Will Pakistan steal a march over India in some of the areas of missile technology?
A#We are not concerned with what is happening in other countries. Our technology is in many ways advanced and ahead of others. Those who borrow technologies cannot be a challenge to those countries which build technologies on their own.

Q#How did you choose to become a scientist?
A#In my school in Rameshwaram, I had a fantastic teacher, Siva Subramania Iyer, who taught us mathematics and science. He got me interested in learning science. Then there were a lot of birds on the island, and I used to watch their beautiful flight paths. That got me interested in aeronautics. I love the sea. I write poetry, I started learning the veena, a beautiful instrument. One day I'll play a concert so that I can make people happy. These days you have to make people happy around you.

Q#What did you feel at the time of independence, when there were riots in India and the subcontinent was partitioned?
A#I was in high school when Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru unfurled India's flag in New Delhi. What I still remember is that the next morning there were two photographs on the front page of the newspaper--one of Nehru unfurling the flag, and the other showing Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation, walking in Noakhali in Bengal, because of the communal riots there. You would normally expect the Father of the Nation to be at the flag-hoisting in the capital, but no, he was far away, removing the pain of the people. That taught me something about our culture that no university education could have.

Q#What did India achieve with the nuclear tests in May?
A#The tests are the culmination of the development of nuclear technology in India, leading to nuclear weaponization. The tests were the result of many years of work by our nuclear scientists and defense technologists. They have generated a very important data base on the fission device as well as the fusion system. Today, India is a nuclear weapons state.

Q#But why did India need to go for nuclear weapons?
A#We gave out three signals. In 1950, Nehru told the United Nations that the U.S. and the then Soviet Union should get rid of their nuclear weapons, go down to zero level. What happened? Both countries accumulated nuclear weapons, from dozens in the 1950s to thousands in 1974. We sent another signal by having a peaceful nuclear test in 1974. What happened then? By the 1990s the figure had reached 20,000 nuclear weapons. And there was proliferation. From one side to China, from the other side to Europe. And it didn't stop there. It even came to Pakistan. So two of our neighbors had nuclear weapons. In such a situation, we didn't have an alternative. For national security reasons, we had to explode nuclear devices.

Q#How do you get back to zero level now?
A#India can live without nuclear weapons. That's our dream, and it should be the dream of the U.S. also. Under the START II treaty, the nuclear arsenals on each side have been reduced to around 3,000 weapons. I asked a top U.S. defense official when it'll come down to zero. He said it won't, it's just a dream. That means the so-called nuclear weapons states want to perpetuate their nuclear weapons status. What's the alternative for India then, especially when two neighbors are armed with nuclear weapons? Still, our Prime Minister has announced, "You go to zero level, we are with you."

Q#Is there a danger of a nuclear arms race on the subcontinent?
A#I'm not an expert on the arms race. But India's national security is a supreme requirement. Just like any developed nation, we will do everything for that.

Q#What about signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty? Should India do it?
A#The five tests we conducted in May generated sufficient data for nuclear weaponization. So both Dr. R. Chidambaram, the Atomic Energy Commission chief, and I have said we need no further tests. As for the CTBT, it is for the nation to take a holistic view on this.

Q#But it's being said that if India is to weaponize properly it must conduct more tests.
A#My job in the defense ministry is to ensure weaponization. There is enormous confusion in the minds of people that while some countries have done thousands of tests, how can India with limited tests go for a moratorium. After their tests, other countries produced 20,000 weapons of 70 different types. India's requirement is minimum deterrence. How many types of weapons we need decides how many tests we conduct. And the definition of minimum deterrence is that which deters our adversaries maximum. Actually, we'd planned six tests in May, but we stopped the last one as we felt we'd got the data we wanted.

Q#Some Western scientists maintain that the strength of the tests was nowhere near what was claimed.
A#What we achieved was very close to what we had predicted. The measuring of the nuclear yield depends on multiple parameters--the location and number of instruments, the geology of the area, the location of the seismic station in relation to the test site. The New Scientist took data from 125 seismic stations and their analysis closely matches ours. We measured it at 5.4 on the Richter scale, which is equivalent to a yield of 58 kilotons, plus or minus five kilotons. The New Scientist estimate is nearer 60 kilotons. Dr. Chidambaram, myself and our team reviewed the data and we're happy with our performance. After all, finally we're the developers and users.

Q#How will the U.S. sanctions and the blacklisting of a number of scientific organizations affect your work?
A#Science is global. Einstein's equation, E=mc2, has to reach everywhere. Science is a beautiful gift to humanity, we should not distort it. Science does not differentiate between multiple races. Actually, in India's case the so-called sanctions have ignited young minds. I'm witnessing it. Every day a new software or hardware product is coming out of my laboratories. No sanction can stand against ignited minds. After all, our nuclear program has faced sanctions for nearly three decades, the missile program has faced sanctions for the last one decade.

Q#Will India go ahead with its missile development program despite the sanctions?
A#India's missile program is a national program with capability for indigenous design, development and production. Originally, the Agni missile program was a technological demonstrator. But global and national security needs forced India to get into the Agni program in full swing. Today, India is a missile power. We are self reliant in our missile program--90% of our items are made in India. We do not depend on any country for any critical technology.

Q#Why is it that India and Pakistan have so much in common, yet are at each other's throats?
A#Europe fought for a hundred years. How many civil wars were there in the U.S.? It's a process. One day on the subcontinent also a transformation will take place.

Q#Do you believe the subcontinent has a common civilization?
A#It has--many languages, many religions, the cultural bonds are there. After all tomorrow's work has to be global. A Tamil poet wrote 4,000 years ago, "All the world's villages are one, all the people are relatives"--relatives, mind you, not just friends. That's the dream of Indian culture, the dream that the world will be one.

Q#I hope we are not taking to much of your time
A#I have a lot of time for you. 

Q#Sir, you are the inspiration of millions, who was your inspiration?
A#My inspiration? Prof Vikram Sarabhai, heard about him? 

Q#Yes, we know Vikram Sarabhai.
A#Well, my earliest inspiration was my science teacher, Sivasubramania Iyer. This man taught me in fifth class, I was 10 then. He was teaching how a bird flies. He went to the blackboard, drew the bird, its tail, nose, beak and wings and started talking about how it flies. You know which year [it was]? 1941. You were not even ideas then. After 45 minutes, he asked how many of us understood. Many students raised their hands. There were 30 of us who did not. He said, "Those who did not understand...come in the evening." Rameshwaram is a small island, with birds flying over the sea. He said, "Just watch, the wings are flapping. Now, the tail lifts, the wings flap and the direction changes." Tell me, what propels a bird? Cars and aircraft have engines, what does a bird have? 

Q#It has life. 
A#Yes, life! Life is what actuates the brain. That's how he would explain. In a few minutes we all understood how a bird flies. But that's not important - what is important is, from that day something got into me, the bird's flight! I was just 10 but the teacher was so good he made me dream.... Flight? Science? I knew in a definite sense, my future had to have something to do with flight. That is how I developed interest in maths and physics. After school, I did aeronautical engineering at Madras Institute of Technology. Then on to rocket engineering at ISRO. That's where my career started. My science teacher put me on this orbit, but the full shape was given by Prof Sarabhai. He was a visionary. It was the '60s. Back then, we had no rocket, no missile, nothing. He gave us a vision statement—India should design and develop high-powered rockets, make communication satellites, remote-sensing satellites.  That was his vision.

Q#Was he the one, your teacher initially, who inspired you to write Ignited Minds?
A#No, Ignited Minds I wrote after meeting young people like you. 

Q#For a man of simple ways, how has the ceremony and fanfare of being a president affected you? 
A# Well, I'm at home with three things, ok?  First is the beautiful nature, you know ... with it, I'm always, I'm home. With flowers, with fragrance, with birds flying, the deer and what not - everything's here. I spend a lot of time. The second thing: I meet 50 to 100 children from various parts of the country. Third thing, I have my scientific agenda and tasks. I'm guiding a scientist for Ph.D. which I was doing when I was in Anna University as a Professor. He was my student, so currently I'm guiding him even now. 

Q#Even now? 
A#Yes, he wouldn't leave me! There's also a fourth thing. I have come here with a mission—India should be transformed into a developed nation. And we are trying to talk to Parliament members, political leaders and legislatures, I'm trying to show we all can live in a developed nation. 

Q#The prime minister said at the ASEAN meet that 54 per cent of India's population is now under 25. What do you feel about this, sir? Ours being a young nation... 
A#Yes, its true, below 20 itself there are more than 200 million people. 

Q#So, what do you feel about this, Sir, since we are getting into this groove of a young nation.
A#I believe it is our wealth. And just like in 1857, they were told to get freedom, and the young people were the first to jump into it. I believe that was the first vision of our nation. The second vision for the nation is transforming it into a developed nation. Out of a thousand, 260 people are below the poverty line. We have to lift them up. If the mission is injected into the minds of the young, then their minds will be ignited, they will transform India into a peaceful and prosperous country. 

Q#Don't you think the youth has to be handled carefully? 540 million young people can be dangerous if they get into the wrong line...
A#We all have passed the phase of youth. Basically, it all depends on family values, which are good in India. So there's a big hope. And regarding the possible problem with the young, it can be tackled by giving a big mission to them. First & foremost, you as a student should excel in academics. Second, over the weekend you can educate the 40% people who are illiterate, without disturbing your studies. Third is: environment is being damaged particularly in the urban areas. You can contribute by organising a "young movement" to conserve environment. You plant trees. Suppose you decide to plant 5 trees before you come out of IIT Kharagpur or Lady Shriram College, and each one of 500 million people plant two trees each, that would become 1 billion trees! The movement of the young always has the ability to excite. Apart from that, you must always have a dream - after economics, after B.A., what will I do? It should be clear: what I want to do in the next 10 years. Similarly, after Civil Engineering, will you become a designer, will you become a manager, a leader? Or as an economist would you become a good professor, or, would you like to contribute in the making of the economic design of our nation? Or, would you like to contribute nationally by participating in the planning of National Development?  Like that, you should have a dream.

Q#You were talking of the youth educating people. At IIT, we have an organisation of students and a few professors, called Prabuddha Bharat, which tries to educate illiterate children outside the campus...
A#I won't call these people illiterate, because may be they have great knowledge - what do you say?

Q#Yes,Sir. Why is it that in our country, people who raise their voice against corruption meet a fateful end? Satyadev Dubey, to quote a recent example. 
A#I have talked about it recently in the 200th session of Rajya Sabha, I've clearly indicated that the freedom to think, the freedom to perform, excel, all is engrained in these three stages of freedom - it is very vital. And also, our constitution permits any person to have the right to perform. There should not be any hurdle for them. In my personal view, for corruption you can put any number of laws, we cannot do anything. Only three people can do something for corruption, i.e., father, mother, and elementary school teacher. When the child is growing, only they can plant the best of thoughts, the best of character. If it done before the age of 20 years, no one can change it. Once a teacher said, "If you give me a student, a child, for 7 years I will teach him and no god or devil can change him. So my feeling is, a corruption-free world has to start in the home. Because then you have a role model. That's why we have to see that we have very good role models - teachers. A good teacher leads a perfect noble life. 

Q#This is what we can do in the future, but what about the youth who want to join now? Because of the prevailing corruption, no one wants to join government organisations...
A#Let me recount two recent events, one in Delhi and another one in south Orissa. I was talking to 400 children in Orissa. After my presentation, I asked them what will they do after 10+2. Many said they want to become doctors, lawyers, engineers, fashion designers, and social workers. One girl got up and said "I want to become a political leader." Everybody laughed, you know. They said , "Why do you want to become a political leader?" I said there's nothing to laugh, at least she has a dream. Lets find out from her, why she wants to become a political leader. She said, "to remove corruption." That is, you should not be frightened and run away from the problem. In Delhi recently, in Vigyan Bhavan, I was addressing 200 children. The same question came up - "what do you want to be"? I want to be an astronaut and all those things, they said. One boy said, "I want to join the IAS". He said he wanted to remove corruption. Please write: "In life, whether while studying or during your professional career, you may encounter problems. Problems should not become your master. (Pauses). You should become the master and defeat the problem".

Q#This is right, Sir, we need to take control of our lives, but in this S.K.Dubey case, what the government does and whether it sees to it that the guilty are punished .... If this does not happen, then may be...
A#No, A probe has started by the CBI and the truth has to come out. 

Q#If something is done, then it would definitely do a lot to boost the confidence of the people who want to fight corruption.
A#No, what I want to do is, you must realise, we are a nation of a billion people, and a professor from USA asked me, "Mr. Kalam, what is the core competence of India?" Now tell me what would you say? Suppose someone would ask you this?

Q#People
A#My answer was, we are a nation of a billion people with multi-cultural, multi-religious, with many languages, what can be our core competence? We have got freedom since 1947. We are democratic since then. We have proved to the world - our core competency is managing and giving leadership to brilliant democratic people. Imagine how your college principal or director manages your college. Nobody else has got an experience of managing a billion people. We have many problems -  who cannot have problems? An aircraft is there. It takes off. Aircraft generates lift that's why it takes off. Drag also comes in. Suppose you make drag zero, then the aircraft will not fly. Similarly in our life challenges are always there. How we encounter the challenge, how we make it successful, that decides how powerful your life is. 

Q#At the end of the day, do you see an end to this corruption?
A#It may take some time for the movement to start. If 300 to 500 million young people said that we want a corruption free India ... Every one of you is a member of a family and you have a responsibility. You decide that whatever happens, I will not help corruption and will not become corrupt - and suppose you take that dream forward? You can change the world. Secondly, from all sectors, family-ties are very important for us in India. And this hope has to become the view of enlightened citizens. It would take about five decades. But if you want a faster action, the young movement will take you there. Thirdly, the nation should have a vision i.e. "I want to live in a developed India". The higher the aim, the lesser will you be affected by the various deviations, various problems. You must articulate it. Fourthly, laws should also take care of the people.

Q#You are very optimistic?.
A#I wouldn't say optimistic. I would say realistic. There is a lot of difference. (Laughs) We need to look at the good aspects of life. Look at the shadows in life, not the sunshine, and have a big goal in life. There are three things: We need to look at everything, the shadows and the sunshine. Have a goal, be happy, appreciate your colleagues, and have good friends —books, apart from your three-dimensional friends! Books have always been my friends. My companions.

Q#What are your five favourite books, that you recommend to the youth?
A#1. 'Light from many Lands', by Lilliam Watson. 2. 'Thirukkural' - an ancient book, by Thiruvalluvar 3. Everyone should have a spiritual book, for me it's the Holy Koran. 4. 'Empires of the mind', by Dennis Waitely. 5. 'To begin where I am', by Czeslaw Miloz.

Q#The youth in Northeast & J&K feel neglected due to lack of opportunities for employment. This resulted in violence in Assam recently. What message do you have for the youth there? How do you reassure them?
A#I have been to all states in the Northeast and to Jammu & Kashmir. My feeling is that there are two things: One is, employment is to be generated. Just like both of you are saying you want to be an entrepreneur and you want to join business - this is beautiful. I have never seen this kind of 100% yield till today. (Laughs).When I go there, most of them want to join government jobs. That is because of the way our education system has grown us. I personally believe when you are studying in Lady Shri Ram college or in IIT Kharagpur, along with your course you should also receive a diploma type, a training for about 6 months of specialising in certain training leading to employment. So that along with your Civil Engineering degree, you have employment potential of giving the country what is immediately required. Maybe, agricultural implements or harvesting methods you could improve, or storing problems, silos. Our problem is that millions of tons of food is wasted because of storing problem. In college they can give you additional computer experience or since you are an economics student, there are three sectors, agriculture, industry and services, so you should have your own choice in college to prepare you for a particular sector. You should have an entrepreneurship capability. The whole economy of the nation comes from the entrepreneurs, the small enterprises. It is not by joining government jobs. People should have the confidence to do what they want to do and the profession that they choose should have a demand in the nation. Have you exhausted all your questions?

Q#No sir! Quite a few more...
A#Some people are waiting outside .. but you tell me..

Q#The safety of women is an issue on everyone's mind... How would you make the women of India feel more secure? 
A#There are three things. First, the law has to be amended to make it more stringent. Punishment should be severe and serve as a deterrent. Second, there should be quick judgement. Cases should not be allowed to pile up. Third, the diagnosis should be carried out properly by the police. [And, there is a fourth], you must have self-confidence.

Q#Do you see movies?
A#For me, you are all movies. Everyday I meet people like you and you are the movie for me.

Q#You don't even watch cricket? 
A#Cricket, I like; commentaries I hear.

Q#Are you interested in Cricket ?
A#In my school and college days I used to play. Now every time I want our people to do well. They did well in Australia.

Q#There seems to be a beacon of hope in the present Indo-pak ties. Do we see peace coming our way? 
A#We have offered, we had peaceful elections. Secondly, our PM has himself volunteered, offered a message, now only by discussion we have to solve the problem.

Q#So how do you think we, as the youth, can help in this?
A#When I was in Kashmir, children told me to allow them to cross the border, spread the message of peace. Looking at history, there is a common civilisational fibre among all Asians. We must look at the common things (that affect common people) like roads, buses, trains, aircraft. Here's a poem, hope you understand it:: "When guns are silent, Flowers blossom on the Earth/ Fragrance engulfs good souls who created beautiful silence" Whoever is responsible for making the guns silent gets the fragrance of the flowers.

Q#Which of the former Presidents inspired you the most?
A#I believe every President before me contributed something in their respective fields — some in politics, some in education and others in social services. At Rashtrapati Bhawan I found a letter from our first President, Rajendra Prasad to Nobel laureate Sir C V Raman in 1954 asking him to come to Rashtrapati Bhawan to accept the Bharat Ratna. Anyone would have jumped at the offer. Then I read Sir CV Raman’s reply to the invitation. It said, “Dear Mr President, I thank you for giving me such a great honour, but I have a problem. I am guiding a scholar and he is submitting his thesis in December-January. I have to sign the thesis and won’t be able to accept the invitation.” For Sir CV Raman, his student’s research meant more than anything else. The Bharat Ratna, of course, was awarded to Dr Raman in absentia. Rajendra Prasad is one of our great Presidents, so is S Radhakrishnan, Zakir Hussain and there are a number of other Presidents too.

Q#One of your passions is the youth of this country. But is there any reason to assume that the youth is any different from the older generation? What make you optimistic about the youth?
A#It’s when children are 15, 16 or 17 that they decide whether they want to be a doctor, an engineer, a politician or go to the Mars or moon. That is the time they start having a dream and that’s the time you can work on them. You can help them shape their dreams. Tomorrow if I address a group of youngsters and talk about the flag flying in my heart and how I will uphold the dignity of the nation, I can get them to dream. But if I talk to people who are 40, 50 or 70 plus, it will not go down that well. Also, the youth have fewer biases about their society as compared to the grown-ups.

Q#Do you think India can successfully develop indigenous defence systems?
A#Many economies in the world are driven by the type of defence systems they sell. If they don’t sell defence systems or products that country’s economy will collapse. So aggressive marketing is going on wherever defence systems are manufactured. India must learn to be competitive too. Competitiveness involves cost, quality and marketing. On your website, in your e-newspaper Billion Beats, and in all the issues you discuss, there is an engagement with ideas but it seems as if you are skirting the social context in which India lives. I will ask you three questions. One, is providing urban amenities in rural areas an abstraction? No, it is the reality. India has 6,00,000 villages but few towns and cities. So if you go to my website, all the lectures will be about how to establish this. Number two, my website talks about the importance of primary education. Third, a nation that does not have a vision dies. My 2020 Vision for India is to transform it into a developed nation. That cannot be abstract, it is a lifeline. That is what my website and my e-paper talk about.

Q#What was the reaction among senior leaders in the government, first in the NDA and later in the UPA, to your vision? Were they just polite or did they take you seriously?
A#First of all, I don’t have a Kalam vision. India 2020 is a national vision. As Prime Minister, AB Vajpayee announced ‘India Vision 2020’ in Parliament and then he announced it at the Red Fort on Independence Day. And he definitely meant it. After Manmohan Singh took over, at a governors’ conference, he said the government would do everything to make ‘Vision India 2020’ a reality. No political system can survive without a vision for the nation.

Q#How did the political class respond to a technocrat President?
A#When I took over as President, I studied the Constitution and the more I studied it, the more I realised that it does not prevent the President of India from giving the nation a vision. So when I went and presented this vision in Parliament and in legislative assemblies, everyone welcomed it, irrespective of party affiliations. Vision drives the nation.

Q#When you addressed your vision to politicians was there ever any friction?
A#Yes, when I touched upon the political side. For example, when I suggested in Parliament that we need a two-party system, there was a lot of criticism. It is all part of the game. That is democracy and that is how we survive.

Q#Did any politician ever tell you this is the business of politics and that you are an oddball?
A#No, they were very comfortable with me. Somehow it clicked because I had no axe to grind. When I say I have a vision for the development of the nation and its rural areas, who can say no? Can you find one politician who can say that development is not necessary for the country? He will not get votes if he does.

Q#In the run up to these elections, there is a general perception that regional parties are driving a hard bargain, that national parties have lost ground. What’s your assessment?
A#This is the era of coalition politics, whether you like it or not. I had promoted the two-party system. But the coalition system is what has emerged. A new situation may emerge. We may have a coalition in the state and a coalition at the Centre and the two coalitions may become two important political parties – like groupings. Like-minded people may come together — even if the ideologies are different — for power or to make the nation prosperous. If you look at the country’s economic record, economic prosperity happened when coalition governments were in power.

Q#What’s the role of the media in nation-building and what will be the shape of media in 2020 and beyond?
A#The media is the only system that can become a partner to national development and in building a good society. I call it ‘media for a billion’. That means, you can’t just be an urban media, you have to be the media of the nation.

Q#Does it worry you that there are not enough people in India who do science and engineering?
A#Science leads to technology, technology leads to products and marketing. The type of technology we used in India has already been developed elsewhere. So if you want to be in the top 10 of the global competitive index, science — the fundamental nature of science – has to grow. I am promoting what is called ‘science cadre’. According to this, 400-500 people who do their MSc and PhD will have assured employment. And then, we need leaders like Sir CV Raman. For him, a Bharat Ratna is not important, a scholar is important. Most of our researchers go abroad. So unless our own education system is reformed, all our best people will go for research elsewhere. I saw the Professor Yashpal report. It talks about our university set up. We have two systems — the university system and the IIT system. The IIT-IEC is a powerful establishment for India as well as abroad. Regarding the university research, a movement has started. Out of 2% GDP for a science and technology. 8% is to be pumped into fundamental research.

Q#How did you tackle Mr Musharraf when he visited India?
A#I met Musharrafji at Rashtrapati Bhawan. Just before that the SAARC countries chief paid a visit and I said that India and SAARC countries have two enemies: poverty and disease. When the former Pakistan President was with me, I gave a presentation to him on how instead of fighting each other, India and Pakistan should get together and fight disease, poverty through development. He calmly heard and smiled.

Q#On the issue of climate change, one of the ideas floating around now is to have sector-based reforms for those industries that emit less. Do you think we are ready for such sector-based reforms?
A#The car you drive in New York, in Kolkata, in New Delhi, produces 30 billion tones of CO2. This car pollution is coming out of fossil fuels which we buy for $45-50 billion. I have been advocating that we go from fossil fuel usage to solar power, to nuclear power and bio-fuel. With bio-fuel, agriculture will also benefit out of that.

Q#You are known as the people’s President, but living in an establishment like Rashtrapati Bhawan, there is a tendency for officials to insulate you. How did you get over that barrier?
A#I, personally, believe that nobody can cordon me off because when I go to schools and colleges there are thousands of students there. Nobody can control them. Only when I talk do they fall silent. It seems to me that I have a communication with the people. How do I communicate with the people? I have a website that is updated; every day I check my email; thirdly, I opened up Rashtrapati Bhawan as the people’s Bhawan. In 2005, a million people came to see the Mughal Gardens and they could meet me too.

Q#The story of your life story is inspirational. Tell us about your years in Rameshwaram and the environment you grew up in.
A#I will recount two incidents. The first incident: in the fifth standard, I was a 10-year-old boy and I had a great teacher, CS Subramanyam Iyer. Subramanyam was a science teacher and he was teaching us about the way birds fly. The same evening, he took us to the seashore at Rameshwaram and showed us, practically, why they flap their wings, how they change their direction. That day he gave me a vision for life. A teacher can do that. That day I decided my area of work would have something to do with flying. I went into physics, then aeronautical engineering, I became a rocket engineer, then I became a rocket technologist, a space technologist. I also flew an aircraft. The second incident. When I was 12 years old, my father became the president of a panchayat board. The same evening, somebody came to visit us. My father had gone for namaaz. The man gave me a packet for my father. When my father came home and asked me what it was and I said it was a form of cake. He opened it and saw a number of silver vessels and other trinkets. He stared at me and then he gave me a beating. He said I had no business to receive the gift. The message for me was that God gives you whatever you need in life.

Q#We’ve talked of science and technology and IT but there is very little talk about Sociology, Political Science even though these subjects are so important. Why are we not even moving forward on certain subjects?
A#Yesterday, I was addressing future IAS officers and I asked them are their subjects. Nearly 60% had taken sociology. Some were engineers, doctors, some commerce and history students. I am insisting that in technical institutions humanities should be included. I am also an advocate of creativity being given primacy up to class eight. My suggestion is that at school, in the afternoon session students should be given vocational training. So they leave school with a school certificate SSLC plus a certificate that they are capable of doing some work. Then their employment potential will increase.

Q#You write a lot about your ideas and views but you never write about going out with friends, watching a film. Don’t you indulge in such activities and if you do, who is your favourite actor?
A#If you ask me about my favourite music, I like traditional music. I have not seen a film in the last 50 years.

Q#Do you think at this point in India’s history we are at a critical juncture where hate speeches are becoming a part of our daily life? How do we combat this?
A#Don’t you think every citizen has a responsibility? I believe a person who has been educated, has a responsibility towards his nation. That is why I used to say every individual should be a good member of a family. Every individual has to be a good member of society. Every individual has to be a good member of the nation. Every educated individual should be a good member of the planet earth. The question is how to make the individual into a good member? Where there is righteousness in the heart, there is beauty in the character. When there is beauty in the character there is harmony in the home. When there is harmony in the home there is order in the nation. When there is order in the nation there is peace in the world. Who will give us that righteousness in the heart? Our parents, our teachers in a spiritual environment.

Q#What are the top most recent achievements that India has reason to be proud of?
A#The Indian economy is in an ascent phase. Particularly, our economy is growing at 8% to 9% per annum for the last four years. However, there is a need to control inflation by increasing productivity, particularly in the consumer sector. There is a marked improvement in our infrastructure such as roads, particularly rural roads, tele-density, international airports, metro-rail connectivity.In the agricultural sector, our food production has increased to 237 million tonnes. It is essential to give highest priority for agro-food processing. This will enhance earning capacity of farmers. In the automobile sector, India has become a leading manufacturer of cars, commercial vehicles and components. The Nano car is an important milestone in the small car segment. Work is also on to convert the automobile to run with emulsified fuel having 75% fuel and 25% water. The PSLV C9 mission launching precisely ten satellites, including eight satellites for international customers.

Q#And where have we failed? What have been our greatest failures and where have we failed our people?
A#While there has been all-round growth in many sectors during the last 60 years, the fact that there are still 220 million people living below the poverty line shows the failure of our system. Hence, connectivity and working with integrity are the immediate solutions. Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas (PURA) which gives physical connectivity, electronic connectivity and knowledge connectivity leading to economic connectivity in rural areas is the possible solution. We need 7000 PURA complexes for covering 600,000 villages in the country.

Q#Dr. Kalam, you say the nation comes before the individual. What is your take on American business owners who have outsourced the jobs of their countrymen?
A#Every nation has to follow a certain policy: Commercial, trade, various other types of policies. The phenomenon of globalization is going on. If you consider the law of development, there are two types of nations. One category holds the developed nations, numbering less than 10, and the second category holds the hundreds of developing nations. Developed nations produce and market products in their own country and throughout the world. Only then can they survive as developed nations. Developing nations want to become developed nations. So, they have to produce products and competitively market them globally. So what is the commonality in the picture? Competitiveness! That is a key concept. Cost, quality, marketing — all make up factors of competitiveness. So, all nations have to work competitively, all nations have to depend on each other, work together. There’s nothing wrong in it.

Q#How do you envision the epic communal divide between Muslims and Hindus bridged in India?
A#Let me tell you a story. The Europeans fought with each other for hundreds of years. They even created two world wars. But today, we see that these same 23 nations have created the European Union. There are rich, not so rich, and poor nations in the EU, and all of them are working towards making Europeans live prosperous, happy lives. So, in India also such changes will happen, in fact throughout the whole world — the earlier the better. To give another example, U.S.A. and U.S.S.R., during the Cold War, generated 10,000 nuclear warheads. Today they are friends. They are saying they are working for world peace, they say they will bring down the number of nuclear warheads. So, historically, this cycle has to come to India too. Good things will happen.

Q#You’ve been called the “Missile Man of India” and the “People’s President.” Is there an incongruity between your desire to empower the world with peace and making India a nuclear power?
A#I am innocent to the whole affair! I did not call myself these names! (laughs). When a nation is surrounded by weaponized nations, she has to equip herself. That’s what India has done. To make the nation peaceful and prosperous, we need minimum security. That’s what we have done.

Q#What was your immediate reaction when “Agni” and “Prithvi” missiles were successful?
A#I was right there and witnessed the whole thing. Courage is key. My message, especially to young people is to have courage to think differently, courage to invent, to travel the unexplored path, courage to discover the impossible and to conquer the problems and succeed. These are great qualities that they must work towards. This is my message to the young people.

Q#And who taught you this message?
A#Myself. I had to learn this myself. Literature also influenced me deeply. In India, we have a famous book called, Thirukkul, written 2,200 years back. I’ll quote a couplet: “If your thoughts are high, definitely you’re going to work for your aim, definitely you will succeed. But conversely, if you don’t have an aim, don’t have high thoughts, how can you aim at success?” My second favorite book is Light From Many Lamps, by (Lillian Eichler) Watson. And the third book that I love is Empire of the Mind. These three books have made my life.

Q#How did you feel when you realized that you didn’t have to support your family with your newspaper route anymore?
A#I was the youngest member of my family, a student when World War II broke out. We were under the British rule at that time and the country was going through some tough times. But after the war ended, I didn’t have to sell newspapers anymore and life returned to normal again.

Q#How come you’re such a transparently sincere person?
A#See, I firmly believe that the nation has to be bigger than the individual and the individual has to work for the nation. If you’re working for yourself, you’ll not be transparent. But once you put the nation above you, you become transparent.

Q#What is your reaction to your selection as NDA nominee for President?
A#I am overwhelmed by the gesture. Being the President of India is an onerous task.

Q#Many say you are being made president because of your religion.
A#Really? To be honest I never thought of it that way at all. I have always regarded myself as an Indian.

Q#What sort of a role would you like to play?
A#For any president the major task is thinking of the best way to integrate the nation. While speaking to 3,000 children in Porbandar recently a young girl asked me what my message was to them. I told her that our minds should be embedded with thoughts of the nation and that the nation is always bigger than the individual. I think that message is relevant here too.

Q#Does being a scientist equip you in any way to perform your new duties?
A#No doubt, this will be a new type of mission. But essentially it is all about leadership and that is something we were trained for, even if the missions may have been different. We had a systems approach of careful analysis, design and integration that is relevant for any type of task. Also, we were not confined to conducting scientific research. We looked at the overall development of the nation.

Q#But you have never handled the intricacies of politics.
A#My own definition of politics is that it is all about creating leaders to evolve policies that will take the country to higher levels. It is a multi-dimensional leadership that focuses on the nation's economic, social and political development. If you look at politics through this perspective then everything falls into place.

Q#How do you view the current tensions between India and Pakistan?
A#I have not had time to study this thoroughly. All I would like to say at this moment is that India is a strong nation. That its strength doesn't come just from its weapons, but from its economic development and maturity in politics.

Q#As president you would have to do things you never really enjoyed doing-like dressing formally and hosting formal dinners. Are you ready to change?
A#Let us say it will be a new experience. Besides, you can achieve a lot of work even while having dinner.

Q#Sir, on August 15, 1947, you were only 16 years old. Where were you on that particular day? How did people react in the streets? How did they celebrate the sudden freedom of India from the centuries old bondage of British rule?
A#Well, it’s a beautiful question. I was born in the small island town of Rameshwaram where I completed my primary school education in the Panchayat school. I went to a slightly bigger town 40 minutes away from Rameshwaram, for my high school studies. At that time only the great event took place for the nation. My teacher, Reverend Teri Solomon, told all of our class boys that they must attend the midnight celebration on 15th August 1947, in the quadrangle of the school. Since I was the school leader, I was asked to organize the assembly of all the students. As I recollect, two events got imprinted in my young mind. First, one flag was lowered and the great Indian tri-color flag was rising. My teacher Reverend Soloman said, “Oh my students, look at the flag which has been flying for over 200 years, it indicates we were ruled. Now, our Indian flag is rising.” It was exactly at 12 o’clock midnight. All of our teachers enjoyed. We students rejoiced. Then Pandit Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, spoke on the radio. All our teachers and the students clapped. Every student got a sweet packet, we started eating. Of course, the freedom was in front of us. My school was awake, everywhere lights, lights, lights, like Deepawali. The spirit of freedom entered in the hearts of every Indian, and manifested itself in smiles on every face.

Q#Mr. President, Dr. Rajendra Prasad was sworn in as the first President of India on January 26, 1950. Did you ever think then or later that you could someday become the President of India? Please share with our viewers your rise to the highest office in the nation; how did this all come about?
A#Well, that dream was not there, not at all. My younger age dream was to fly, as inspired by my primary school teacher, Subramaniam Iyer. One day, he taught us how a bird flies. The way he taught us how a bird flies led me to want something to do with flight. Of course, he injected in me an ambition that I must fly in life. After my aeronautical degree, it was a disappointment that I was not selected by the Air Force. But then, I was fortunate that the space program got started by the visionary Dr. Vikram Sarabai then, and I was entrusted with the project for the design and development of the first satellite launch vehicle for the country. That led me to my initiation into integrated missile development program. Both these programs gave me an insight on putting technology and people in the organization together for realization of complex missions. I was also getting exposed to some societal needs, particularly through integration of medical and engineering disciplines. Then came the exciting experience of evolving India mission 2020 with the help of a great team. That led me to my lifetime passion of interacting with the youth. I took up a teaching assignment at Anna University on Technology for Societal Transformations. At that time, the nation offered me the opportunity of serving as the President of India. I saw in this a call of duty, for me to spread the message of vision 2020 for an economically developed nation.

Q#Sir, I was born in New York but my parents originally came from India. So each year, I celebrate two Independence Days; one on the Fourth of July as an American and the other on August 15 as an Indian. What advice would you like to give to NRIs in America, in relation to their country of birth and their country of adoption?
A#Riti, I am glad that you celebrate Independence Day of both U.S.A. and India. My greetings to you and your family! My advice to all NRIs, whichever country they are working and living, they should all contribute their best for the welfare of that country where they are living. Regarding their nation of origin, NRIs can share their knowledge and experience of success in life. The message on this greatest day of the year for the biggest democracy of the world is wherever you are you can contribute to peace and prosperity of humanity as a whole which will lead to global happiness. I used to hear a hymn in my country, that I would like to convey to the youth in India, America and other parts of the world. Where there is righteousness in the heart, there is beauty in the character, Where there is beauty in the character, there is harmony in the home, Where there is harmony in the home, there is order in the nation, Where there is order in the nation, there is peace in the world.

Q#How do you view the debate over the nuclear deal which you have endorsed? Does the deal have the potential to emasculate indigenous science and technology efforts, as some critics fear?
A#The deal has nothing to do with Indian science. Definitely, this deal will put pressure on nuclear scientists and India to become self-reliant in thorium-based nuclear reactors.

Q#2020, when you had said India will become a developed nation, is now not very far away. What do you see as hurdles in our path? How can they be overcome?
A#I believe it is essential that economic prosperity has to reach 700 million people who are in the rural areas. The solution is establishment of 7,000 PURAs (Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas) across the country and graduating our economic development measure from growth in GDP to growth in National Prosperity Index, NPI.

Q#After your term as President has ended, you continue to criss-cross the nation. Do you find any change in the popular mood from the time you were Rashtrapati to now?
A#What I see is that the youth is restless. They want to contribute to make India great. he time has come to launch a youth movement for national development. This, I am progressing.

Q#Sir, you recently supported the India-US Nuclear Agreement, which many don't know if it is good or not for India. Could you explain why it is good and what will India get if this deal is passed?
A#Passage of this deal will enable India to get uranium from many countries for the existing uranium-based power plants. It will also accelerate the pace of development of thorium-based reactors using the fast breeder system which will eventually make India self-reliant. It will definitely be useful in our energy independence mission.

Q#With inflation and slowing down of the growth rate, how do you see it impacting the opportunities for the youth of this country?
A#Normally high productivity in the consumer sector will have tremendous effect in bringing down inflation. It can be seen whenever oil price is hiked, it has an impact on inflation. Our solution is the nation has to go for energy independence. That means we have to come out from the dependence on fossil fuels (oil, gas and coal).

Q#mmmmm errr, Sir, shall I, no, shall we…..
A#Lady, if I would have been married in my young days, I would surely have had a daughter of your age. Consider that and you may start with your interview dexterously.

Q#Sir, if this is so and as we all know you are so much fond of kids, opportunate me to begin with the ever wondered question, why didn’t you marry?
A#If I had married, I would never have achieved even half of what I have managed now. I was too busy in work and didn’t find time to get married. Henceforth, have kept nothing for me, neither wife nor children and earthly possessions

Q#Well, that would inspire many. What ideations do you carry in mind when you sleep at night, Sir?
A#Transformation of India into a developed country and smiles on the faces of my people. That is my dream

Q#You have made India believe it can be a superpower, how do you envisage the boiling blood of youth will accord to it?
A#Youth needs to be channeled to a prolific task like INDIA VISION 2020. They have to be inspired with the feeling that “I can do it”, “we can do it” and “the nation can do it

Q#Sir, you have been matured to this gray hair now, still how do you connect with students so well?
A#Same age, lady

Q#Sir, tell us about some incident in your life, which can be a morale booster to many students and youngsters?
A#My life, which has been long and eventful, has seen great heights of success and failures. You will have to read my autobiography “Wings of fire” to know all what inspired me throughout.

Q#Sir, how come you are such a transparent person?
A#My belief is that the nation has to be bigger than the individual and the individual has to work for the nation. Working for oneself is not transparency, but once you put the nation above you, you become one

Q#Sir what is the main terror that threatens the development of our country?
A#Ignorance!!

Q#You are so perfect in your words, that every bit of it has ignited minds in various arenas. What would you like to convey them?
A#Visualize whether the experience and education will embellish you to give to being human; probably that is your stage of performance. As a young citizen of India, armed with technology, knowledge and love for the nation, I realize that small aim is a crime

Q#Thank you so much Sir for your valuable time and words
A#If you really want to thank me, explore and contribute in making a developed India by 2020. It is not just a vision in minds, rather a mission that we can all take up and succeed.

Q#Dr Kalam, our interest is in looking at the role of technology in the overall developmental context. In the current economic scenario, what are your thoughts on the role of technology? On the one hand, even after fifty years of independence, while we still do not have enough water, roads, food, and education for our people, on the other hand, we are spending large amounts on technology. Is this the best way to apportion our public spending?
A#Yes, indeed. Technology is important for the all-round development of any country—in fact, technology needed for sustainable development has to be given the highest priority. However, the current economic situation needs a new thinking. When the world market is under difficulty, particularly in terms of purchasing power, India faces the challenge of activating the development of 6,00,000 villages. PURA (Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas) can facilitate three kinds of connectivity—physical, electronic, and knowledge—which together will enhance the economic connectivity for the cluster and generate large scale employment.

Q#Do you think India is satisfactorily pursuing technology?
A#As far as technology is concerned, the real resources are generated in our engineering colleges, particularly the IITs— in fact they are the birth place of science and technology. The technological skills developed here finally take different shapes. They may be used in agriculture for agriculturalproduction, particularly for producing high yield variety of agriculture seeds—a step that has actually led to the ‘green revolution.’ Today, the 210 tonnes of food that we produce is because of the agricultural science transformed into technology. Similarly, if you take the space programme, today, for reaching out to our 6,00,000 villages, we have got communication satellites, with nearly 150 transponders in the geocentric orbit and remote sensing satellites in the polar orbit. So, on one side, while our space science and technology connect the country and the world, on the other side, remote sensing satellites enrich us on our resources—water resources, geological resources, and geographical conditions, e.g., telling us about the intensity and direction of the cyclones—fulfilling the societal requirements. Nuclear science gives nuclear technology for generating power. Radiation therapy for cancer treatment is also an outcome of nuclear science. There are many more such contributions of technology in diverse fields. In the IT industry, a battery of young population, all young graduates from various academic institutions have facilitated software exports worth $ 50 bn. Further, we have all been witness to the big revolution in the medical science in the form of inventions such as angiography, angioplasty, X-ray, scanning, etc. Thus, in every area—be it the medical science or agriculture science, space science, atomic energy, or any other field—technology is playing an important role for service of humanity, particularly in India.
